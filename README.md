# Dynamic-Boundary-Ice-Rink-CFD-Model-Data
CFD dataset for a generalized ice rink model with dynamic boundary conditions. Includes simulation data (ice surface temperatures, grid exports) from STAR-CCM+ and processed input parameters (meteorological time-series, occupancy) generated with MATLAB. Supports the development and validation of thermodynamic models for indoor ice rinks.
